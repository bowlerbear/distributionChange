# Distribution Change
a project to explore the multi-dimensional nature of species' distribution changes

### simulations

A series of simulation to explore how different metrics of distributional change area related

This will roughly do the following
- generate an initial distribution (gridded landscape in which some fraction is occupied)
- assume some % loss or gain
- calculate a range of distribution metrics at each time step

### empirical

Analysis of Odonata data from sMon to explore change. 
01 -  get models - these are from the sMon project
02 -  extract simple statistics from the predicted distributions
03 - playing with fragmentation statistics
spline_function.R - functions for the analysis of the empirical data
