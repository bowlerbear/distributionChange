# Distribution Change
a project to explore the multi-dimensional nature of species' distribution changes

### simulations

A series of simulation to explore how different metrics of distributional change area related

This will roughly do the following
- generate an initial distribution (gridded landscape in which some fraction is occupied) 
-  assume some % loss or gain 
-  calculate a range of distribution metrics at each time step 

### empirical

Analysis of Odonata data from sMon to explore change. 
- 01 get models - these are from the sMon project
- 02 extract simple statistics from the predicted distributions
- 03 playing with fragmentation statistics
- 04 separate regions into core and marginal and look at change in each
- 05 core_function - all the main functions 
- 06 spatial_patterns - maps and stuff
